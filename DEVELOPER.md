# Git etiquette

See [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://github.com/LeapYear/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING)

# Documentation

All code should be fully documented, whether it's adding comments for future
developers or adding Haddock docs for functionality exposed in Haddock.

Changes that affect users should be mentioned in `CHANGELOG.md`. When doing so,
add an entry under under the `Upcoming` header containing:
* A description of the change
* The type of change (breaking, bugfix, etc.)
* If applicable,
    * How to migrate existing code
    * When it should be used
    * What it supersedes

The format is not important, as the list will be curated when releasing.
